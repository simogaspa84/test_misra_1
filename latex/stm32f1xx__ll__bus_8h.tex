\begin{DoxyVerb}                    ##### RCC Limitations #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
    A delay between an RCC peripheral clock enable and the effective peripheral
    enabling should be taken into account in order to manage the peripheral read/write
    from/to registers.
    (+) This delay depends on the peripheral mapping.
      (++) AHB & APB peripherals, 1 dummy read is necessary

  [..]
    Workarounds:
    (#) For AHB & APB peripherals, a dummy read to the peripheral register has been
        inserted in each LL_{BUS}_GRP{x}_EnableClock() function.\end{DoxyVerb}
